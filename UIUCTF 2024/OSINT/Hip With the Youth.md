# Hip With the Youth
The Long Island Subway Authority (LISA), in an attempt to appeal to the younger generations, has begun experimenting with social media! See if you can find a way to a flag through their Instagram.

This is part one of a three-part OSINT suite including Hip With the Youth, An Unlikely Partnership, and The Weakest Link. I recommend starting here!


# Solution

To find the profiles, log into Instagram and search for "Lisa Long Island" to find this profile [longislandsubwayauthority](https://www.instagram.com/longislandsubwayauthority/). In the bio, there's a link to her Threads account: [@longislandsubwayauthority](https://www.threads.net/@longislandsubwayauthority). While exploring her Threads account, I discovered some comments, and among them was the flag.
