# Night

That was quite a pretty night view, can you find where I took it? Flag format: uiuctf{street name, city name} Example: uiuctf{East Green Street, Champaign}

Some words are blurred out to make the challenge harder, hopefully.

Flag format clarification: Use the full type, e.g. Avenue, Street, Road, etc., and include a space between the comma and city name.

# Solution 

By performing manual searches using reverse image tools like Google Lens, I discovered that the keyword "Boston" was highlighted. Further investigation led me to identify the building as the "Prudential Tower." Once the building was identified, it was a matter of pinpointing the precise location to find the perfect angle. Here is the exact location on Google Maps:
