After dropping numerous 0days last year Bridget has flown the coop. This is the last picture she posted before going dark. Where was this photo taken from?

NOTE: Flag is case-insensitive and requires placing inside DUCTF{}! e.g. DUCTF{name_of_building}

# Solution

This is a basic Google Lens or Google Images challenge. Uploading this image to Google Images. although the bridge supports are quite SIMILAR, which brings you to Singapore's Robertson Bridge. The challenge asked for the location from which the photo was taken, with the name_of_the_building as the flag. In this case, it's the Four Points by Sheraton. 

It helped me a lot to use Google Street View, position myself on the bridge and look up to roughly match the angles. The photo was taken near the top and from the left window, where the building's elevators are.

### Flag: DUCTF{four_points_hotel}
