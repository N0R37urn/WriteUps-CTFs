# mem_search
### 211pt Hard

I found an unknown file, and upon opening it, it caused some strange behavior, so I took a memory dump!

How was the attack carried out?

The memory dump is large, and you can download it from the following URL (it will be 2GB when extracted).

Please note that the file may become unavailable after the WaniCTF event.
